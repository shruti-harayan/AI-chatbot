Hospital chatbot using aiml and python

Creating a hospital chatbot using AIML and Python involves defining the AIML files for the chatbot's responses and setting up a Python script to interact with the AIML engine. 
Hereâ€™s a step-by-step guide to help you get started:

Step 1: Define AIML Files
startup.xml
This file is used to load other AIML files.
hospital_chat.aiml
This file contains the actual chatbot responses.

Step 2: Write the Python Script
Create a Python script to load the AIML files and handle user interactions.

Step 3: Run the Script
Save your AIML files (startup.xml and hospital_chat.aiml) in C:/Users/Asus/OneDrive/Desktop/shruti/.
Save your Python script in a convenient location.
Run the Python script.
You can expand or modify this file to include additional categories or refine the responses based on specific needs or scenarios.
